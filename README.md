Naming and URL Scheme
---

You must use a consistent naming scheme for all projects in this course.
If we can't find it, we can't grade it.

By default Glitch often assigns your application a random name. To change it, click on the project dropdown menu in the upper left corner of Glitch. You will then see an additional text field displaying the project name in the resulting menu; click here to edit the name.

The name scheme should be `a1-yourGitHubUsername`.
The `a1` will need to be updated to `a2`, `a3`, and so on in future projects.
